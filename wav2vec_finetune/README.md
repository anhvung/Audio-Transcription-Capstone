# Finetuning Wav2Vec 

## End to End Pipeline
An end to end workflow of the finetuning pipeline can be found in the KR_wav2vec2_XLS_R_finetune.ipynb and wav2vec_finetune_hebrew.ipynb notebooks.

## Evaluation of Models
Examples of how to run the finetuned model and pretrained model on eval examples can be found in the wav2vec_finetune_hebrew_eval.ipynb and wav2vec_hebrew_eval.ipynb notebooks. We only pushed the Hebrew example due to redundancy, but it should be the same for the other languages.
