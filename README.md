Exploration of an open source-based ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) solution that enables custom training for Acoustic as well Language model. The solution will leverage publicly available pre-trained acoustic model that can be fine-tuned with small amount of domain specific data. 

We will start to explore Meta AIâ€™s wav2vec 2.0 Framework for acoustic model.
Further to improve the accuracy, we will experiment (training/finetuning) with a language model based on n-gram with KenLM or Transformer architecture. Once the models are trained, evaluate the models using KPI Word-Error-Rate (WER) by decoding audio data with acoustic in combination with language model.
